Protocol:

Terminals register to be stations.

They receive updates from the server when data changes.  That should happen
approximately once per simulation tick, though shouldn't rely on that so the
server can change simulation rates, implementations, etc.

Terminals send commands to the server.  They can provide graphical
representations of the fact that the command has been initiated, but shouldn't
do too much simulation on their own -- we want the server to decide what the
result of the action should be.
