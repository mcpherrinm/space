SPACE ROGUE is a game where you fly a spaceship.

It is a multiplayer game.  Each person plays a role in flying the ship.

Your computer is your control of the ship.  It talks to an API for the role you
are playing.  You send actions to the ship's master computer, and it sends you
updates for your sensor displays.

It really should feel like you're using a future computer, not playing a game.
Including multiple applications and stuff might add to that.  Web browser?
Chat room?  Silly little games (minesweeper?)

The ship simulator should be hooked up to a "main screen", ideally a big TV
that the whole bridge crew can see.
